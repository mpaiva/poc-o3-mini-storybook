# Create a Storybook Codebase with Comprehensive Mantine UI Components, Enhanced Accessibility, Multiple Themes, AG Grid, Tailwind CSS, and Design Tokens Managed by Style Dictionary

**Context:**  
You are a senior front-end developer tasked with building a complete, production-ready codebase. The project must include:

- A Storybook instance to display a gallery of **all Mantine UI components** from `@mantine/core` (or a robust, comprehensive set covering every available component).
- An **AG Grid** example.
- Enhanced accessibility measures (WCAG 2.2 compliant), including semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and keyboard navigability.
- An enhanced **skip navigation (skip-nav)** component based on [PayPal’s SkipTo](https://github.com/paypal/skipto) to help users quickly jump to the main content.
- Support for **multiple themes**: light, dark, solarized-light, solarized-dark, monokai, dracula, and tomorrow. These themes will be managed via design tokens using Style Dictionary.
- An **accessibility settings** component that allows users to adjust:
  - Text size
  - Spacing
  - Font-family for headings and text paragraphs
  - Line-height
  - Paragraph spacing

Tailwind CSS will be used for styling, and its configuration will integrate design tokens generated by Style Dictionary.

**Requirements:**

1. **Storybook Integration:**
   - Create a `.storybook` folder containing:
     - **`main.js`**: Main Storybook configuration.
     - **`preview.js`**: Global Storybook preview settings (e.g., CSS imports, global decorators).

2. **Mantine UI Components:**
   - **Comprehensive Coverage:**  
     Include stories and component examples for **all** Mantine UI components from `@mantine/core`. This should cover:
     - **Basic Controls:** e.g., `Button`, `TextInput`, `Checkbox`, `Radio`, `Select`
     - **Display Components:** e.g., `Badge`, `Avatar`, `Loader`
     - **Layout Components:** e.g., `Grid`, `Group`, `Stack`, `Container`
     - **Feedback Components:** e.g., `Alert`, `Notification`, `Progress`
     - **Overlays & Modals:** e.g., `Modal`, `Popover`, `Tooltip`, `Drawer`
     - **Data Display:** e.g., `Table`, `Card`, `Paper`
     - **Other Components:** Any additional components available in Mantine UI.
   - **Accessibility Focus:**  
     Ensure every component example and story follows WCAG 2.2 guidelines using semantic HTML, appropriate ARIA attributes, and full keyboard navigation support.

3. **AG Grid Integration:**
   - Create a dedicated sample component (e.g., `AGGridComponent.jsx`) integrating AG Grid.
   - Provide a corresponding Storybook story (e.g., `AGGrid.stories.jsx`) demonstrating a fully functional data grid.

4. **Enhanced Skip Navigation Component:**
   - Develop an enhanced skip-nav component (e.g., `SkipNav.jsx`) inspired by [PayPal’s SkipTo](https://github.com/paypal/skipto).
   - Ensure it is accessible, easily discoverable on focus, and include a Storybook story (e.g., `SkipNav.stories.jsx`).

5. **Accessibility Settings Component:**
   - Build an accessibility settings component (e.g., `AccessibilitySettings.jsx`) that allows users to adjust:
     - Text size
     - Spacing
     - Font-family for headings and paragraphs
     - Line-height
     - Paragraph spacing
   - Implement a global state or context so that these settings apply across the application.
   - Include a Storybook story (e.g., `AccessibilitySettings.stories.jsx`) demonstrating its effect.

6. **Tailwind CSS Integration:**
   - Provide a `tailwind.config.js` file configured to integrate with design tokens from Style Dictionary.
   - Include a `postcss.config.js` file for setting up Tailwind CSS via PostCSS.

7. **Design Tokens via Style Dictionary with Multiple Themes:**
   - Create a `src/theme` folder containing design tokens.
   - **Multiple Themes:**  
     Include token definitions for the following themes:
       - light
       - dark
       - solarized-light
       - solarized-dark
       - monokai
       - dracula
       - tomorrow  
     These can be structured as separate JSON files (e.g., `light.json`, `dark.json`, etc.) or as sections within a single `tokens.json`.
   - Create a `style-dictionary.config.js` file to configure Style Dictionary so that it generates assets (e.g., CSS variables) for each theme, which Tailwind CSS can utilize.

8. **Directory Structure:**

   The project should have the following structure:

   ```Text
   /
   ├── .storybook/
   │   ├── main.js
   │   └── preview.js
   ├── src/
   │   ├── components/
   │   │   ├── AccessibilitySettings.jsx
   │   │   ├── AGGridComponent.jsx
   │   │   ├── SkipNav.jsx
   │   │   ├── (All Mantine UI components, e.g., Button.jsx, TextInput.jsx, Checkbox.jsx, Radio.jsx, Select.jsx, Badge.jsx, Avatar.jsx, Loader.jsx, Grid.jsx, Group.jsx, Stack.jsx, Container.jsx, Alert.jsx, Notification.jsx, Progress.jsx, Modal.jsx, Popover.jsx, Tooltip.jsx, Drawer.jsx, Table.jsx, Card.jsx, Paper.jsx, etc.)
   │   ├── stories/
   │   │   ├── AccessibilitySettings.stories.jsx
   │   │   ├── AGGrid.stories.jsx
   │   │   ├── SkipNav.stories.jsx
   │   │   ├── (Stories for each Mantine UI component, e.g., Button.stories.jsx, TextInput.stories.jsx, etc.)
   │   └── theme/
   │       ├── tokens.json   // Alternatively, multiple token files: light.json, dark.json, etc.
   │       └── style-dictionary.config.js
   ├── tailwind.config.js
   ├── postcss.config.js
   └── package.json
   ```

9. **Dependencies:**  
   Your `package.json` should include (but not be limited to) the following dependencies:
   - **React** (and React DOM)
   - **@mantine/core**
   - **Tailwind CSS**
   - **PostCSS**
   - **Style Dictionary**
   - **Storybook** packages (e.g., `@storybook/react`)
   - **AG Grid** packages (e.g., `ag-grid-react`, `ag-grid-community`)
   - Additional packages as needed for accessibility and theme management.

10. **Documentation and Comments:**  
    - Include code comments and inline documentation explaining key integration points:
      - How design tokens (with multiple themes) are exported via Style Dictionary and integrated into Tailwind CSS.
      - Accessibility enhancements and WCAG 2.2 compliance in each component.
      - The setup and usage of the enhanced skip-nav component.
      - How the accessibility settings component updates global UI parameters.
    - The output should be clear enough for another developer to install dependencies (via `npm install` or `yarn install`) and run Storybook (e.g., using `npm run storybook`) without further modifications.

**Instructions for the o3-mini Model:**

- **Objective:**  
  Generate a complete, working codebase following the above requirements.

- **Output Format:**  
  For each file, output the file path as a header (or comment) and then its complete contents enclosed within escaped triple backticks. For example:

  ```javascript  
  /package.json  
  ```json  
  {  
    "name": "storybook-mantine-accessibility-aggrid-tailwind-style-dictionary",  
    "version": "1.0.0",  
    ...  
  }
  ```

- **Details:**
  - The generated codebase must include all configuration files, component files, story files, and theme files as described.
  - Add comments within the files to clarify any non-trivial configurations or code decisions.
  - Ensure that the code is syntactically correct and ready for installation and execution.
  - For Mantine UI, include stories for every available component in `@mantine/core` (or a robust, comprehensive subset) to serve as a full component gallery.
  - Include a dedicated AG Grid component and corresponding Storybook story.
  - Incorporate the enhanced skip-nav component and the accessibility settings component as described.
  - The design tokens should support multiple themes and be integrated into Tailwind CSS via Style Dictionary.

**Final Note:**  
Your output should be a complete, self-contained project demonstrating the integration of Storybook, a comprehensive set of accessible Mantine UI components, AG Grid, an enhanced skip navigation component, multiple themes via design tokens, Tailwind CSS, and an accessibility settings component. Each file's content should be fully provided so that the project can be recreated from the output.
